**Adolphe Appia (1862-1928)**

>  ‘if everything in the auditorium at Bayreuth expresses his [Wagner's] genius, on the other side of the footlights everything contradicts it’ (1925, cited in Bablet 1982, 68).<sup>1</sup>

Born in Switzerland in 1862, Appia was a theorist, designer, and director best known for his influence on modern European design. He helped to establish the role of the scenographer and pushing for innovations in lighting design. He was fascinated by idea of the _Gesamtkunstwerk_, Richard Wagner's operas, and worked to fixing what he took to be the limitations of Wagner's own ability to imagine a staging worthy of his works and of stagecraft generally. The Festspielhaus at Hellerau, which he was largely responsible for designing, is seen as an implementation of his ideas.

Appia staged production of Wagner's _Tristan und Isolde_ and _Ring_ during his lifetime, but today these are rarely discussed. He is best known for his theories.

> "In 'Retour a la musique" (1906), Appia criticized the passivity of the public which allowed a work of art to be placed "in front of us, outside of us . . . it is there, we are here, always distinct.' He blamed this passivity ("anaesthesia") in part on the theatres, 'ugly and built contrary to good sense." In 1908, Appia wrote: 'In our modern theatres, the places meant for the public are as dis tinct as possible from the space where the action takes place; and perfection seems to us attained at Bayreuth: there, the proscenium frame is no more than an immense key hole (pardon me!) through which we indiscretely surprise mysteries which are not meant for us"<sup>2</sup>
