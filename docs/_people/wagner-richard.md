**Richard Wagner (1814-1883)**

Born 1814 in Leipzig in what is now modern Germany. He went into exile in Switzerland and France after taking part in a failed revolt in Dresden.

Wagner is best known for championing the idea of the _Gesamtkunstwerk_. The idea is most clearly implemented in his Ring Cycle and in the design of the Bayreuth Festspielhaus.

Wagner is often associated with the Nazi regime. Hitler repeatedly named him as an inspiration. Wagner published many anti-Semitic tracts during his lifetime.

Famous works: _Tristan and Isolde_, _Ring Cycle_, _Parsifal_
